# Introduction

In this data analysis I will be analyzing data scientist job salaries (USD) by the proportion of remote work they do, the company size as well as by their experience level in the work year of 2022 for full-time employees. I will be comparing these 3 factors and checking which one correlates with average salary most, and then visualize these results. My hypothesis is that the experience level and company size will positively correlate with salary, and the proportion of remote work done will not correlate with salary. I will make use of Python, Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib), and MySQL.

This dataset has been retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niyalthakkar/data-science-jobs-analysis.

# Results

The results that were found through this analysis are:

```
The correlation between salary and proportion of remote work is 0.15.
The correlation between salary and company size is -0.02.
The correlation between salary and experience level is 0.62.
```

Data visualizations are in files.
