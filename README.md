# Introduction

In this analysis I will be analyzing data science job salaries (USD) by the proportion of remote work they do, the company size as well as by their experience level in the US. I will be comparing these 3 factors and checking which one correlates with average salary more. My hypothesis is that the experience level and company size will positively correlate with salary, and the proportion of remote work done will not correlate with salary. I will make use of Python, Python libraries (Pandas, MatplotLib), and MySQL.
